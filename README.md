# Incident priorities

| Priority | Description | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Critical | Text-to-speech in [monitoring-alerts](https://git.blunix.com/miscellaneous/monitoring-alerts) |
| P2 | High | List in [monitoring-alerts](https://git.blunix.com/miscellaneous/monitoring-alerts) but do not text-to-speech |
| P3 | Moderate | List in [monitoring-alerts](https://git.blunix.com/miscellaneous/monitoring-alerts) `overview.py` |

Check priority: 1
System priority: 2
Actual priority in [monitoring-alerts](https://git.blunix.com/miscellaneous/monitoring-alerts): 2
